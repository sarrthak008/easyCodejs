includes():

This method checks if an array contains a specific element.
It returns true if the element is found, and false otherwise.
In your code:
cities.includes("pune") will output true because "pune" is in the cities array.


indexOf():

This method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array.
If the element is not present, it returns -1.
In your code:
cities.indexOf("morve") will output -1 because "morve" is not in the cities array.
toString():

This method converts an array to a string by concatenating all of its elements, separated by commas.
In your code:
cities.toString() will output the string "pune,satara,mumbai,dellhi".
You also have a couple of methods commented out, but they're good to know:

reverse():

This method reverses the order of the elements in an array in place. This means it modifies the original array.
If you were to uncomment cities.reverse(), the cities array would become ["dellhi", "mumbai", "satara", "pune"].
sort():

This method sorts the elements of an array in place. By default, it sorts elements as strings in alphabetical (ascending) order.
If you were to uncomment cities.sort(), the cities array would be sorted alphabetically: ["dellhi", "mumbai", "pune", "satara"].
